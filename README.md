## Events leading up to Halo: Combat Evolved

### 100,300 BCE/BC

The Forerunners, an ancient race of space-faring scientists, make first contact with a parasitic organism known as the Flood. The Flood-Forerunner war begins.

### 100,000 BCE/BC

After 300 years of fighting, the Flood has conquered much of the galaxy. As a last resort, the Forerunners fire the Halo rings, a series of weapons designed to wipe out all sentient life, denying the Flood of its food source. Both the Forerunners and the Flood are annihilated.

### 852 BCE/BC

The Sangheili (Elites) and the San 'Shyuum (Prophets) put an end to years of fighting to form the Covenant. They begin their hunt for Forerunner artifacts, as well as absorbing other species into their massive war machine. These include the Grunts, the Jackals, the Hunters, the Drones and the Brutes.

### 2163

The United Nations Space Command, or UNSC, is formed as a militarized, exploratory division of Earth's government.

### 2291

Humanity discovers slipspace, allowing for the development of the "Slipspace drive" and faster-than-light travel.

### 2321

The ORION Project, a secret bio-engineering experiment, is green-lit. While it shows promise, the ORION project is ultimately deemed a failure.

### 2362

Humanity begins colonizing Reach, a planet that would eventually become one of the UNSC's largest military research bases.

### 2491

The ORION Project is re-initiated. The first successful batch of augmentees are code-named "SPARTANs."

### 2506

The ORION is shuttered yet again due to mental issues caused by the project's biological augmentations. Most SPARTAN-Is remain active.

### 2511

A young boy named John is born.

### 2517

Using research from the ORION Project as a stepping stone, Dr. Catherine Halsey greenlights the SPARTAN-II Project. Potential SPARTAN candidates, all of whom are children, are kidnapped and replaced with clones before being brought to Reach for training.

### 2525

The SPARTAN-IIs undergo biological augmentation. Of the original 75 candidates, only 33 survive the augmentation process and remain active. Humanity makes first contact with the Covenant on an agricultural colony named Harvest. A revolutionary exoskeleton system, named the Mjolnir Mk. IV, is developed. It becomes the SPARTAN-II's standard equipment.

### 2531

The SPARTAN-III Project, designed to produce cheaper, disposable Spartan soldiers, begins in secret.

### 2540

### 2549

Office of Naval Intelligence publicly reveals the SPARTAN-IIs in order to boost morale. Cortana, a revolutionary A.I. system, is created from Catherine Halsey's cloned brain.

### 2551

The Mjolnir Mk. V armor, complete with reverse-engineered energy shields, is developed and adopted by the surviving SPARTAN-IIs.

### 2552

Commander Jacob Keyes defeats a Covenant fleet orbiting a human colony. However, the Covenant plant a tracking beacon on Keyes' ship and discover the location of Reach.
