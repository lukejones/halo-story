# Halo Storyline

This is the complete storyline for the Halo series in chronological order. If you see any errors, please submit an issue or fork and I will merge.

## The Beginning

### 100,300 BCE/BC

The Forerunners, an ancient race of space-faring scientists, make first contact with a parasitic organism known as the Flood. The Flood-Forerunner war begins.

### 100,000 BCE/BC

After 300 years of fighting, the Flood has conquered much of the galaxy. As a last resort, the Forerunners fire the Halo rings, a series of weapons designed to wipe out all sentient life, denying the Flood of its food source. Both the Forerunners and the Flood are annihilated.

### 852 BCE/BC

The Sangheili (Elites) and the San 'Shyuum (Prophets) put an end to years of fighting to form the Covenant. They begin their hunt for Forerunner artifacts, as well as absorbing other species into their massive war machine. These include the Grunts, the Jackals, the Hunters, the Drones and the Brutes.

### 2163

The United Nations Space Command, or UNSC, is formed as a militarized, exploratory division of Earth's government.

### 2291

Humanity discovers slipspace, allowing for the development of the "Slipspace drive" and faster-than-light travel.

### 2321

The ORION Project, a secret bio-engineering experiment, is green-lit. While it shows promise, the ORION project is ultimately deemed a failure.

### 2362

Humanity begins colonizing Reach, a planet that would eventually become one of the UNSC's largest military research bases.

### 2491

The ORION Project is re-initiated. The first successful batch of augmentees are code-named "SPARTANs."

### 2506

The ORION is shuttered yet again due to mental issues caused by the project's biological augmentations. Most SPARTAN-Is remain active.

### 2511

A young boy named John is born.

### 2517

Using research from the ORION Project as a stepping stone, Dr. Catherine Halsey greenlights the SPARTAN-II Project. Potential SPARTAN candidates, all of whom are children, are kidnapped and replaced with clones before being brought to Reach for training.

### 2525

The SPARTAN-IIs undergo biological augmentation. Of the original 75 candidates, only 33 survive the augmentation process and remain active. Humanity makes first contact with the Covenant on an agricultural colony named Harvest. A revolutionary exoskeleton system, named the Mjolnir Mk. IV, is developed. It becomes the SPARTAN-II's standard equipment.

### 2531

The SPARTAN-III Project, designed to produce cheaper, disposable Spartan soldiers, begins in secret.

### 2540

The Cole Protocol is established in order to prevent the Covenant from finding Earth. If capture is inevitable, captains must destroy their ship's A.I. and self-destruct.

### 2549

Office of Naval Intelligence publicly reveals the SPARTAN-IIs in order to boost morale. Cortana, a revolutionary A.I. system, is created from Catherine Halsey's cloned brain.

### 2551

The Mjolnir Mk. V armor, complete with reverse-engineered energy shields, is developed and adopted by the surviving SPARTAN-IIs.

### 2552

Commander Jacob Keyes defeats a Covenant fleet orbiting a human colony. However, the Covenant plant a tracking beacon on Keyes' ship and discover the location of Reach.

## Halo: Reach

A squad of SPARTAN-IIIs dubbed "Noble Team" discover Covenant reconnaissance squads on Reach. Sixty percent of the entire UNSC fleet is redirected to Reach in response. Despite heavy UNSC resistance, the Covenant are able to capture most of Reach within days of arriving.

John-117, now known as the Master Chief, is introduced to Cortana. They are separated when the Master Chief leaves to defend the UNSC Pillar of Autumn, while Cortana stays behind to work with Dr. Halsey. Dr. Halsey learns of the true nature behind the SPARTAN-IIIs.

Noble Team arrives to save Halsey and are ordered to bring Cortana to a ship-breaking facility and rendezvous with the Pillar of Autumn. Save for a single SPARTAN-III, Noble Team is killed while transporting and defending the Pillar of Autumn. Cortana successfully makes it aboard and reunites with the Master Chief.

Cortana then provides Captain Keyes with a set of coordinates given to her by Halsey. After jumping to slipspace, the Pillar of Autumn arrives at a massive, ring-shaped facility.

## Halo: Combat Evolved

After arriving at Halo, the Chief and Cortana escape via lifeboat. Keyes crash-lands the Pillar of Autumn into Halo. On Halo, Chief and Cortana reunite with the surviving marines before rescuing Keyes from the Covenant. The group decides to split up, with the Chief searching for Halo's control room while Keyes investigates a supposed Covenant weapons cache. Master Chief finds the control room, only for Cortana to send him to stop Keyes. The Chief is too late, and learns of the Flood.

After fighting his way through the Flood, the Chief meets 343 Guilty Spark, Halo's A.I. monitor. Guilty Spark promises to help the Chief wipe out the Flood by activating Halo, but Cortana reveals that this would wipe out all life in the galaxy. Guilty Spark turns on the Chief once the activation is halted. Cortana and the Chief escape and plan to destroy Halo by detonating the Pillar of Autumn's reactor.

After killing a Flood-infected Keyes, the Chief and Cortana are able to destroy the Pillar of Autumn and Halo along with it. The local Flood infestation and most of the Covenant fleet are wiped out in the ensuing explosion.

## Halo: First Strike (Canon Novel)

The Master Chief and Cortana rendezvous with survivors from Halo's explosion. Together, they hijack a Covenant carrier and head back to Reach. On Reach, the Chief finds the few remaining SPARTAN-IIs and Catherine Halsey. They retreat to the captured Covenant vessel and flee the system.

The group discovers that the Covenant knows of Earth's location, and find one of the largest fleets ever recorded preparing to attack. The Chief and Cortana plan a counterattack, while Halsey absconds with Kelly-087. Despite losing one of the SPARTAN-IIs, the Chief manages to destroy the fleet. The survivors, having delayed the Covenant invasion, head back to Earth to warn the UNSC of the impending attack.

## Halo 2

While the Master Chief is being honored as a hero on Earth, the Covenant fleet commander who oversaw the destruction of Halo is deemed a heretic. The Covenant fleet arrives at Earth. The Chief manages to slow the Covenant advance until one of the Prophets initiates a slipspace jump in-atmosphere. Master Chief and a single ship are able to follow, but much of the city of New Mombasa is destroyed in the resulting blast.

*_At this point, the ‘ODST’ events begin_*

A squad of Orbital Drop Shock Troopers deploys into New Mombasa as the Prophet warps into slipspace. The squad is scattered by the shockwave. After regrouping underneath New Mombasa, the squad discovers a Covenant Engineer trying to defect to the UNSC. They successfully rescue it and manage to escape the city.

*_Halo 2 resumes_*

The Covenant fleet commander is pardoned and dubbed the Arbiter. His first task as the "Blade of the Prophets" is to assassinate a heretic leader. The Arbiter succeeds in killing the heretic leader, only to learn that 343 Guilty Spark had inadvertently been behind the heretic's revolt.

Master Chief arrives at Delta Halo, and after fighting through Covenant forces, manages to kill the Prophet of Regret. The Chief is thrown into the ocean by a retaliatory orbital bombardment and is pulled under the surface. The Arbiter arrives at Delta Halo and manages to find the installation's firing trigger before being betrayed by the Brutes.

Both the Arbiter and the Chief are saved by the Gravemind, a massive Flood intelligence. They agree to work together to keep Delta Halo from firing, and they split up. As a result of the Brutes being promoted to the Prophets' elite guards, the Elites secede from the Covenant and a civil war begins.

Dr. Halsey and Kelly-087 arrive at Onyx, a Forerunner Shield world. After reuniting with a group of SPARTAN-IIIs, the survivors are trapped within the core of the planet.

Master Chief is sent aboard a massive Covenant space station and proceeds to chase down the Prophets. He manages to board the Prophets' vessel, the Dreadnaught, before it escapes, but is forced to leave Cortana behind. The Arbiter is sent back to the surface of Delta Halo to stop the Brutes from activating the ring. He is successful, but all Halo installations are left on stand-by.

Both the Prophets and the Master Chief arrive back to Earth. The rescued Engineer from Halo 3: ODST reveals why the Covenant is attacking Earth: a massive Forerunner artifact is buried beneath the planet's surface.

## Halo 3

After escaping Covenant capture aboard the Dreadnaught, Master Chief returns to Earth using a piece of the hull as a heat shield. The UNSC recovers the Chief. After escaping a Covenant ambush, Master Chief leads an assault that allows the UNSC fleet to attack the Dreadnaught.

Before the UNSC can take the Prophets down, the Covenant opens a Forerunner portal and warps away from Earth.

The Flood arrives on Earth via an infected Covenant carrier. The Master Chief is able to contain it long enough to allow the Elites to purge the infestation.

After discovering a message from Cortana, the Chief decides to follow the Prophets through the portal. He arrives at Installation 00, otherwise known as the Ark. The Chief fights through both Covenant and Flood armies. He and the Arbiter manage to stop the Prophet of Truth from activating the entire Halo array, and the Covenant fleet is wiped out.

They then discover a "replacement Halo" (based on the one that was destroyed in Combat Evolved) being constructed aboard the Ark. As the ring is still unfinished, firing it would not trigger the other Halo installations, and Master Chief decides to use this exploit to finish off the Flood once and for all.

In order to use the new Halo, the Chief rescues Cortana from the center of the Flood infection. They then travel to the control room, and after a brief skirmish with 343 Guilty Spark, Master Chief manages to activate Halo.

Halo fires and begins to tear itself apart. Master Chief, Cortana and the Arbiter survive the detonation, but during their escape through the portal back to Earth, the ship is cut in half. The Arbiter returns home, while the Chief and Cortana are left drifting.

## Events between Halo 3 & Halo 4

### 2553

Following the war against the Covenant, the SPARTAN-IV Program is greenlit. Halsey and a small group of survivors are rescued from Onyx's core. The UNSC immediately arrests Halsey.

### 2557

The UNSC Infinity is officially commissioned.

## Halo 4

Cortana wakes the Chief from his cryosleep after their ship reaches a Forerunner planet named Requiem. After a brief firefight, the Chief, Cortana and local Covenant forces are pulled inside the planet. Once inside, Cortana broadcasts a distress signal, which is picked up by the UNSC Infinity. Cortana reveals that she is suffering from "rampancy," a condition in which A.I. "think themselves to death." Master Chief inadvertently awakens the Didact, an ancient Forerunner war criminal. The Didact takes control of the Covenant forces on Requiem.

The Infinity arrives at Requiem and is pulled inside the planet's core. After the ship crashes, Master Chief finally reunites with the UNSC. Cortana and the Chief attempt to free the Infinity from Requiem's core. Along the way, the Chief meets with the Librarian, an ancient Forerunner scientist. She reveals the Didact's greatest weapon, the Composer, which he used to turn ancient humans into psychotic artificial intelligences.

The Librarian alters the Chief's genetic makeup, immunizing him to the Composer's effects.

Following another firefight, Infinity is freed from Requiem's core. The Chief stays behind (against orders) to stop the Didact. The Chief fails to stop the Didact from leaving Requiem and follows him to Gamma Halo.

After retrieving the Composer, the Didact wipes out the UNSC research team at Gamma Halo. Master Chief and Cortana are the only survivors. The Didact heads to Earth, and the Chief follows. He and Cortana manage to infiltrate the Didact's ship.

Master Chief manages to knock the Didact into the Composer and detonates a nuclear warhead, destroying the weapon. The Chief survives thanks to a hard-light shield created by a fully-rampant Cortana. After saying goodbye, Cortana dies.

Months after losing Cortana, the Master Chief reunites with a squad of SPARTAN-IIs nicknamed "Blue Team." Together, they defeat the Didact yet again, who had survived his fall into the Composer.

## Events between Halo 4 and Halo 5 - The Year 2558

The Infinity returns to Requiem in order to clean up the remaining Covenant threat. Halsey is brought to Infinity to help the UNSC's research efforts but is ultimately captured by the Covenant. She discovers a Forerunner "map" that details the location of all Forerunner technology in the galaxy.

The SPARTAN-IVs on Infinity are ordered to execute Halsey. Despite being shot, Halsey survives and remains in Covenant captivity. Covenant leaders activate Requiem's fail-safe, which sets the planet on a collision course with its sun. The Infinity barely manages to escape.

## Halo 5: Guardians

Fireteam Osiris is deployed to the Jul 'Mdama's splinter Covenant faction-controlled planet of Kamchatka to retrieve the rogue Dr. Halsey, who claims to have information on a series of devastating attacks on several human worlds, during a battle between Covenant forces and the Prometheans. While the team is successful in retrieving Halsey and eliminating the Covenant leader Jul 'Mdama, Halsey informs them that a new threat is about to emerge.

Elsewhere, the Master Chief leads Blue Team on a mission to secure a derelict ONI research station known as Argent Moon. The arrival of a Covenant fleet forces Blue Team to scuttle the station instead. During the sabotage, the Chief receives a cryptic message from Cortana, directing him to the planet Meridian. John is ordered to return to Infinity upon destroying Argent Moon, but he and Blue Team disobey orders and set out after Cortana, forcing Captain Lasky to list the rogue Spartans as AWOL. This causes consternation aboard Infinity, as Halsey believes that Cortana's survival through the use of Forerunner technology makes her unpredictable and untrustworthy.

Lasky gives Fireteam Osiris the aim of finding and capturing Blue Team. Osiris is deployed to Meridian to pursue Blue Team, where they find a human colony under attack by Promethean forces. During their pursuit, they encounter the Warden Eternal, a Promethean serving as Cortana's enforcer. After temporarily defeating the Warden, Osiris catches up to Blue Team, ordering them to stand down and return to Infinity. Chief bests Locke in hand-to-hand combat and flees with the rest of Blue Team as they board a Guardian, a kind of large Forerunner constructs built as enforcers of entire worlds. Osiris barely escape the colony's collapse as the Guardian activates and disappears. The Guardian emerges on the Forerunner planet Genesis, where John and Cortana reunite. Cortana says her terminal rampancy was cured by the same Forerunner technology that saved her.

Osiris is deployed to the Sangheili homeworld of Sanghelios, where they plan to use a dormant Guardian that resides there to travel to Blue Team's location. However, the planet is engulfed in civil war; the remaining forces of the Covenant have chosen to make their last stand there. To hurry their mission, Osiris joins forces with the Arbiter and help him strike a crucial blow at the Covenant remnant. Osiris boards a Guardian with the help of Commander Palmer while the Arbiter finishes off the last Covenant troops.

On Genesis, Osiris encounters the planet's caretaker, the artificial intelligence 031 Exuberant Witness, who allies with them to stop Cortana. Osiris catches up to Blue Team, who reveal Cortana is planning on using the Guardians to achieve galactic peace through forcible disarmament. Master Chief, aware of the massive devastation Cortana's plan will cause, attempts to convince Cortana to stand down. She refuses and confines Blue Team in a Forerunner prison, to prevent them from interfering with her plan. Osiris manages to transfer control of Genesis back to Exuberant, who wrests the prison from Cortana as she leaves the planet via a Guardian.

Artificial intelligences across the galaxy begin swearing allegiance to Cortana and her plans. Cortana locates Infinity and prepares to disable it, but Lasky has the ship's AI Roland, who is still loyal to Infinity, engage slipspace away from Earth and commit to random jumps until they can develop a way to combat Cortana. With Blue Team recovered, Osiris returns to Sanghelios to reunite the SPARTAN-IIs with an injured Commander Palmer, Thel'Vadam, and Halsey. If the player completes the game on Legendary, an extra cutscene shows an unknown Halo installation powering up while Cortana hums, before cutting to black.
